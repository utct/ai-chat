Purpose 

Arc Intensive Care Information System (Arc System) is an expert clinical information management system  designed  specifically  for  the  treatment  processes  of  intensive  care  clinics  in  hospitals. This document provides a user manual for the Arc System.

Target Audience and Reading Suggestions 

This document is intended to guide the end users to understand and use the Arc System features.  

Indications for Use 

The ARC System is an intensive care information system indicated for aggregating, displaying, and managing physiologic and other patient information. The system collects and displays data from FDA- cleared patient bedside medical devices and patient information systems. The Arc System allows healthcare  professionals  to  define  rule-based  algorithms  to  receive  notifications  for  patient prioritization and continuous patient monitoring. 

The  ARC  System  software  is  intended  to  be  used  by  healthcare  professionals  for  the  following purposes: 

- To remotely consult, regarding a patient's status 
- To remotely review other standard or critical near real-time patient data, waveforms, and alarms in order to utilize this information to aid in clinical decisions and deliver patient care 
- To create and manage Patient Prioritization Rules 
- To access Patient Prioritization information 

WARNING: 

- Rx Only. 
- Do not use the ARC System as an active patient monitoring. 
- Do not use the ARC System to replace any part of the hospital's device monitoring. 
- Do not rely on the ARC System software as the sole source of patient status information.

23\.6.1 Less Than/Greater Criterion  

Age (in years) must be greater than 25 years. 

Age (in years) must be less than 25 years. 

Age (in years) must be greater than or equal to 25. Age (in years) must be less than or equal to 25. Age (in years) must be equal to 25.

2. Range Criterion 

Decision support algorithms should be triggered for patients whose hospitalization period is between 30-45 days.  

Decision support algorithms should not be triggered in patients whose hospitalization period is not between 30-45 days. 

3. Presence Criterion  

If Natt Score is not present, it cannot be triggered for patients. If Natt Score is present, it can be triggered for patients.

*Figure 88 Presence Criterion*

7. Actions 

In the "Actions" field, the actions that the created algorithm will take after it runs can be determined. In this section, Nurse Care, Score and Scales, Medication treatments, Analysis, Examination, Pathology Requests, Consultations and Diagnoses can be made. 

If "automatic" box is checked, the selected actions will be automatically assigned to the patient when the algorithm runs and will not prompt for confirmation. 

If “automatic” box is unchecked, Arc DSS will send notifications to clinicians with suggested actions and it will prompt for confirmation to take suggested action. 

**For example;**  

When “Pupil” is selected from the Scales section, after the algorithm runs, the Pupil Scale task will be assigned for the patient with the selected frequency/duration information and it will be requested to be completed.

8. Data to Be Used 

In the "Data to be used" field, the data time and frequency are selected for the parameters that we add as a rule to trigger the algorithm on a time basis. ![](Aspose.Words.a4fef6f5-f4f5-4237-ba01-2776ae37f2c8.138.png)![](Aspose.Words.a4fef6f5-f4f5-4237-ba01-2776ae37f2c8.139.jpeg)

*Figure 90 Data to Be Used*

1. Use Latest Data 

When "Use latest data" is checked, triggering is completed based on the last data on the patient. 

2. Duration 

In the "Duration" field, it allows the selected parameters to be time-based and triggered as a result of the selected measurement time. The frequency with which the time will be measured is selected on the basis of seconds, minutes and hours. 

3. Function Type 

Function type can be minimum, maximum, mean, median, etc. The type of evaluation in which the function type will be selected determines the type of evaluation that will measure the data to be used for the algorithm. 

3. Minimum  

**For example;** 

In case the SPO2 rule is required to be less than 95, the data to be used is based on the smallest of the values in the 60-minute measurement interval. 

![](Aspose.Words.a4fef6f5-f4f5-4237-ba01-2776ae37f2c8.140.png)

*Figure 91 Minimum*

4. Maximum 

In case the SPO2 rule is required to be greater than or equal to 95, the data to be used is based on the largest of the values in the 60 minute measurement interval. 

![](Aspose.Words.a4fef6f5-f4f5-4237-ba01-2776ae37f2c8.141.png)

*Figure 92 Maximum*

5. Median  

**For example;** 

In a case where the SPO2 rule is desired to be less than 95, the data to be used should be selected as the median, and it should be based on the median of the values from the 60-minute measurement interval. 

![](Aspose.Words.a4fef6f5-f4f5-4237-ba01-2776ae37f2c8.142.png)

*Figure 93 Median*

5. Mean 

**For example;** 

In case the SPO2 rule is required to be less than 95, the data to be used is based on the average of the values received in the 60-minute measurement interval.

![](Aspose.Words.a4fef6f5-f4f5-4237-ba01-2776ae37f2c8.143.png)

*Figure 94 Mean*

6. All 

**For example;** 

In case the SPO2 rule is required to be equal to 95, the data to be used is based on all the values in the 60-minute measurement interval. 

![](Aspose.Words.a4fef6f5-f4f5-4237-ba01-2776ae37f2c8.144.png)

*Figure 103 Add Prioritization Rule Button*

The Patient Prioritization screen has several key sections that include required fields.  

These sections: Clinics, Color, Priority, Rules, and Date To Be Used.  

- The Clinics field is a drop-down box and allows the rule to be created for a clinic or all clinics. 
- The Color allows a color to be assigned to the created rule. 
- The Priority is being used to set the priority value for the rule. 
- The ‘Rules’ section is being used to write the prioritization rules. 
- The ‘Data to Be Used’ section is being used to set data time intervals and calculation types of the parameters. 
- You can create the rule using the 'Create' button on the lower right of the screen.

Security Principles 

Arc System users should take basic security actions of web-based application usage. There are some principles to follow for Arc System users.  

- **Accountability Principle** 

The responsibilities and accountability of users of Arc System and other parties concerned with the  

security of Arc System should be explicit.  

- **Awareness Principle**  

In order to foster confidence in Arc System, users of Arc System and other parties should readily be able, consistent with maintaining security, to gain appropriate knowledge of and be informed about the existence and general extent of measures, practices and procedures for the security of Arc System.  

- **Ethics Principle** 

Arc System and the security of Arc System should be provided and used in such a manner that the  

rights and legitimate interests of others are respected.  

- **Multidisciplinary Principle**  

Measures, practices and procedures for the Arc System should take account of and address all relevant considerations  and  viewpoints,  including  technical,  administrative,  organizational,  operational, commercial, educational and legal.  

- **Proportionality Principle**  

Security levels, costs, measures, practices and procedures should be appropriate and proportionate to the value of and degree of reliance on the Arc System and to the severity, probability and extent of potential harm, as the requirements for security vary depending upon the Arc System.  

- **Integration Principle**  

Measures,  practices  and  procedures  for  the  security  of  Arc  System  should  be  coordinated  and integrated with each other and with other measures, practices and procedures of the organization to create a coherent system of security.  

- **Timeliness Principle** 

Public and private parties, at both national and international levels, should act in a timely  

coordinated manner to prevent and to respond to breaches of security of Arc System.  

- **Reassessment Principle** 

The security of Arc System clients should be reassessed periodically, as Arc System and the  

requirements for their security vary over time.
