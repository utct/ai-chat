1. **Overview** 
1. **Presentation** 

Arc Box is a high performance and highly reliable connectivity device designed especially for medical devices used in intensive care units. Arc Box can be used wired through the serial port or wirelessly . It is designed to  transfer data from bedside  monitors,  ventilators,  infusion  pumps  and  other  medical  devices  to external systems instantly for the purpose of clinical information systems. 

**Note: The Arc Box is not intended to monitor patient data and is not intended to  administer,  control,  or  interfere  with  any  medical  device  to  which  it  is connected. There are no other known contraindications for the use of the Arc Box.** 

Arc Box and its cables are mounted directly next to the patient bedside and connected to the Intensive Care Information System or Hospital Information System with a wired or wireless connection. 

The  Arc  Box  does  not  compromise  data  coming  from  the  medical  device (however, this does not include data not being transmitted and delays in data transmission). 

Arc Box does not interfere with the operation of the medical device that it is connected to. 

2. **Intended Use** 

Arc Box is a serial port reader-enabled integration device that provides wired and wireless network connection. The Arc Box provides IEC 60601-1 coverage for access to medical devices and connections to medical devices as defined.

2. **Setting up the Arc Box** 
1. **Unpacking and Inspecting the Package Contents** 

Before installing the Arc Box, you must unpack and check its contents. 

1. **Package Contents** 
- Arc Box 
- Power cable: The power cable used to connect the Arc Box to a power outlet. This power cable is adapted to the local requirements of each country. 
- User's manual 
- Additional Cables: Depending on the content of your order, other connectors such as serial cables, patch cables may be included in the shipment. These additional elements are typically shipped in the same box as the power cable. 
2. **Unpacking the Cartons** 
- Turn the carton so that the arrow on the package is pointing up. Cut the tape on the carton.  
- Check all items against the packing list, as well as against the list in section 2.1.1, Contents. 
- Remove the packing material and examine each item for any signs of shipping damage. 
- Save all packing materials, the invoice and the bill of lading. You will require them if you need to process a claim with the carrier. 

**Note**: If the carton is broken, open, or damaged in any way, do not accept the shipment. 

2. **Deploying the Arc Box** 
1. **Possible Deployments** 

For compliance with IEC 60601-1, the Arc Box is not classified as a portable device. 

Instead, the Arc Box must be deployed as one of:  

- Fixed configuration: 
  - horizontally (for example, on a flat surface) 
  - vertically (for example, on a wall) 
- Transportable configuration 
- for example a roll stand or cart 
2. **Precautions for All Deployments** 

**Warning:** Fire and explosion hazard. Do not operate the Arc Box in the presence of a flammable anesthetic mixture with air, oxygen, or nitrous oxide; in oxygen-enriched environments; or in any other potentially explosive environment.  ![](Aspose.Words.7afd4684-fe7c-401b-821a-32653cfcb615.003.png)

**Caution:**  

- When deploying the Arc Box, refer to the requirements applicable to medical equipment systems in the standard IEC 60601-1.  
- Do not place the Arc Box inside furniture or inside any enclosed space. This could prevent correct cooling of the device and interfere with radio communications.  
- Operate the Arc Box only within the environmental conditions described in the “Technical Information” of the Arc Box in this document.  
- Do not stack the Arc Box or place it next to other equipment. If you do, then check it for normal operation running its usual configuration.  
- In semi-private rooms, connectors must be placed or labeled so that they clearly indicate the bed for which they collect data.  
- For best practice, mount the ARC Box on a wall or place it on a tabletop away from high traffic areas. Keep cables out of reach and off the floor.  
3. **Recommendations for Wall-mounted Deployments** 

The Arc Box can be mounted horizontally on any side of the bed without impairing its usability. 

When deciding where to place the Arc Box at the point of maintenance, Ordinatrum Solutions recommends that you consider the following points. 

- Mount the Arc Box on the wall or unit in the patient room. 
- Make sure the serial port(s) face right or left for ease of medical device connection and maintenance. 
- If there are medical devices connected to the ports on the Arc Box, place the Arc Box on the same side of the bed as those devices. 
- Mount the Arc Box at a height of no more than 1.5 meters or less than 1 meter from the ground to allow medical personnel easy access to the Arc Box. 
- Be sure to consider the length of cables required to connect medical devices with the Arc Box. 
3. **Connecting the Arc Box to the Power Supply** 

The Arc Box can receive electrical power by: 

- With the power cord connected to the power supply 

**Caution**: 

- Always use the hospital-grade, AC power cable delivered with the product to connect the Arc Box to an AC power source. Do not, under any circumstances, use any other cable than the one provided, even to provide extra cable length. The use of any other cable can result in increased emissions or decreased immunity of the device with regards to electromagnetic interference. 
- Do not connect the Arc Box to an AC outlet that is controlled with a switch or dimmer. 
- Do not use extension cords or adapters of any type. 
- The power cable and plug must remain intact and undamaged. 
- The power plug must remain accessible to unplug the device from the power supply mains if necessary. 

**Note:** If the Arc Box loses electrical power in the event of a power outage, no data will be transmitted from the medical devices during the power-off period and during a reboot. 

**2.3.1.  Using the Delivered Power Cable** 

The Arc Box is shipped with a power cable that is adapted for use with local electrical outlets. 

1. Plug that power cable into the Arc Box at the AC-in power connector. 
1. Plug the other end of that power cable into an electrical outlet.

3. **Powering Operations of Arc Box** 

Plug the power adapter cable  into the Arc Box. The device will start to receive power without the need to use any keys. 

1. **Powering On** 

For manual operation, set the Power On/Off switch, located on the side of the ARC Box opposite to the serial ports, to the On position. The LEDs respond as follows: 

`            `**Power LED   : Green** 

`            `**Ethernet LED  : Green, then off if not connected.**  

2. **Powering Off** 

To power off the ARC Box, disconnect the power cable from the power socket. 

Note: When you power off an ARC Box, the   ARC Box immediately stops sending vitals data. 

3. **Rebooting Arc Box** 

To reboot the device, you can unplug-plug the power cable. You can choose reboot on the interface to reboot the device. 

4. **Resetting Arc Box** 

If for any reason, you find it necessary to reset an ARC Box and return it to its original configuration, it is not enough to power off. Instead, perform the following: 

- Make sure that the device is powered on. 
- You can only do the reset ARC Box with software. 
- When the resetting is completed, the ARC Box has been reinitialized to use its factory configuration, such as DHCP mode and wired mode network communication. 
4. **Connecting Arc Box to the Network** 
- To connect the Ethernet connector port to the network, use an Ethernet (LAN) cable.  
- For the location of the Ethernet connector port, refer to the illustrations in section 3.1, Components on the ARC Box. 
- Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet connector port. 
- Plug the other end of the same cable into the network socket (typically on the wall). The Ethernet LED lights up when the connection is active. During data transmission, this LED blinks.  
- Plug the other end of the same cable into the network socket. The Ethernet LED lights solid orange when the DHCP connection is not active. 
5. **Connecting Medical Device to the Arc Box** 
- Attach the prepared for the medical device into the protocol output and the USB end into the ARC
